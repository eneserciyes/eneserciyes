### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Enes, an undergraduate research assistant at [KoÃ§ University Autonomous Vision Group](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/fguney/). In the past, I co-founded [KU AIRS](https://airs.club/) and have led the [SPARK](https://eneserciyes.github.io/projects/spark/) team and built an autonomous car from scratch.

Here are some of the projects I am working on: 

- [WorldOnRails.jl]() : an unofficial Knet.jl implementaion of "Learning to drive from a world on rails" (ICCV'21 Oral)
- [SPARK-lib]() : a tutorial initially intended for Teknofest Robotaxi but relevant for everyone starting autonomous driving
- [carlatools]() : an extensible CARLA Simulator utility library

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on end-to-end autonomous driving with RL.
